# Simple Calculator
This is a console application which can parse and evaluate simple mathematical expressions.

These expressions can contain:

- 32-bit integer numbers
- Operators + - * / ^
- Brackets ()

Prefixed numbers, i.e. +100, -100 are not supported.

The console application will read, from the console, lines containing the expressions, and output, to the console, the answer.

E.g.
| Input | Output |
|-------| ------ |
| (100+200)*3+99 | 999 |
| 6^2+1 | 37 |
